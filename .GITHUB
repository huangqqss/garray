GIT
========

## Work flow
cd /var/tmp
git clone git@github.com:/huangqqss/garray	# Clone via SSH to ./garray
cd /var/tmp/garray
#cp ~/garray/* . -R # Coding and copy files locally in ./garray
git add .	# add files to Index and it will be available for later undoing
git commit -m "comment"	# make a snapshot of the current state as HEAD
git push origin master	# push current state onto remote server

## Useful commands
ssh -T git@github.com	# Confirm RSA keys working
git init	# Initialize a new git repository (on remote server)
git remote -v	# List the remote server of this working space

## Basic idea
The clone (local repository) has three parts:
      * working directory: where I modify the regular files and directories;
      * Index: storing the tree of added undoes;
      * HEAD: the last commit result.
Index and HEAD are stored in .git, which collects all meta information and
      resides in the working directory.
