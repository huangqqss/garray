Description: Organize a so-called ragged array as generalized arrays, which
	is simply an array with sub-dimensions denoting the subdivision of
	dimensions (grouping of members within dimensions).
	By the margins (names of dimensions and sub-dimensions) in generalized
	arrays, operators and utility functions provided in this package
	automatically match the margins, doing map-reduce style calculation
	along margins.  Generalized arrays are also cooperative to R's native
	functions that work on simple arrays.
