git init
# initialize a new git repository (on remote server)
git clone git@github.com:/huangqqss/garray
# Clone from remote server via SSH to ./website
git remote -v
# List the remote server of this working space

# The clone (local repository) has three parts:
#	* working directory: where I modify the regular files and directories;
#	* Index: storing the tree of added undoes;
#	* HEAD: the last commit result.
# Index and HEAD are stored in .git, which collects all meta information and
#	resides in the working directory.
# Remote	>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>pull>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>	working
# Remote	>fetch/clone>	HEAD	>>>>>>checkout>>>>>>>>>>	working
# Remote	<<<<<push<<<<	HEAD	<<commit<<	Index	<<add<<	working

git add .
# add files to Index and it will be available for later undoing
git commit -m "comment"
# cd to website and make a snapshot of the current state as HEAD
git push origin master
# cd to website and push the current state onto remote server
